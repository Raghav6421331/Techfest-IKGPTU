        Geneva is the second-most populous city in Switzerland (after
        
        Zurich) and is the most populous city of Romandy (the Frenchspeaking
        
        part of Switzerland). Situated where the Rhone River
        
        exits Lake Geneva (French Lac Leman), it is the capital of
        
        the Republic and Canton of Geneva.

        Geneva is widely regarded as a global city, mainly because of
        
        the presence of numerous international organizations, including
        
        the headquarters of many of the agencies of the United Nations
        
        and the Red Cross. It is also the place where the Geneva
        
        Conventions were signed, which chiefly concern the treatment
        
        of wartime non-combatants and prisoners of war.
